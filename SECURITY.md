## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Joanium, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, email: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]

Include the following in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand and address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Security Considerations

- Joanium stores data locally by default under `Data/`
- API keys and credentials are stored in local config files
- Review the `Config/` and `Data/` directories to understand what data is persisted
- Connector integrations (Gmail, GitHub) require OAuth or token-based auth
