> **Joanium** is a local-first AI desktop app that goes far beyond a chat window. It knows your projects and files, runs automations on a schedule, operates background agents, connects to GitHub / Gmail / Drive, and supports every major AI provider — all without sending your data to the cloud.

---

## 🎬 Demo

<!-- TODO: Add a screen recording / GIF here — even a short one will dramatically increase engagement -->

> 📸 Screenshots and a demo GIF are coming soon. In the meantime, [download the app](https://www.joanium.com/download) and see it for yourself.

## 🤔 Why Joanium instead of ChatGPT or Claude.ai?

Those are great chat apps. Joanium is a different product entirely — it lives on your machine, understands your workspace, runs jobs while you sleep, and plugs into the tools you actually use.

| Capability                        | ChatGPT / Claude.ai       | **Joanium**                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Reads your project files          | ❌ Upload every time      | ✅ Always in context        |
| Runs tasks on a schedule          | ❌                        | ✅ Automations + Agents     |
| GitHub, Gmail, Drive integrations | ⚠️ Limited / plugin-based | ✅ Native first-class tools |
| Your data stays on your machine   | ❌ Cloud only             | ✅ 100% local-first         |
| Use any AI model                  | ❌ Locked in              | ✅ 10+ providers            |
| Works fully offline               | ❌                        | ✅ With Ollama / LM Studio  |
| Extensible with custom tools      | ❌                        | ✅ Skills, Personas, MCP    |
| Background autonomous agents      | ❌                        | ✅ Built-in                 |

## ✨ Features

### 💬 A chat that knows your work

Joanium loads your active project, reads your files, runs terminal commands, handles attachments, and maintains separate chat history per project. Not a blank box — a genuine coworker.

### ⏰ Automations that run themselves

Set up a job once — _"every morning, pull the latest GitHub issues, summarise them, and ping me on Slack"_ — and it just runs. No babysitting required.

Built-in **data sources**: RSS feeds, Reddit, weather, crypto prices, file reads, URL fetches, GitHub events, and more.
Built-in **outputs**: notifications, file writes, webhooks, terminal commands, Slack messages, email, and integration-specific actions.

### 🕵️ Background agents

Reusable scheduled prompts that run against any model, any project. Perfect for daily code reviews, changelog monitoring, PR summaries, or anything you'd otherwise have to remember to ask manually.

### 🎭 Personas & 🧠 Skills

- **Personas** change _how_ the assistant thinks — drop in a "senior code reviewer" or a "startup copywriter" and the whole interaction shifts instantly.
- **Skills** are markdown docs that teach the assistant _what_ to do — enable the ones you need, disable the rest. Both are just plain files you can edit, version-control, and share.

### 🔌 Real integrations, not wrappers

GitHub · GitLab · Gmail · Google Drive · Google Calendar · Google Sheets · Google Docs · Google Contacts · YouTube · Google Tasks

All connected as first-class tools the assistant can actually invoke mid-conversation.

### 🧩 MCP (Model Context Protocol) support

Connect any MCP-compatible server and expose its tools directly to the assistant. The ecosystem is growing fast — Joanium keeps up.

### 🛍️ Marketplace

Browse and install community-built Skills and Personas with one click. Publish your own.
