# Joanium

Joanium is a local-first Electron desktop app for people who want an AI assistant that can actually work with projects, files, tools, schedules, personal context, and real integrations instead of acting like a thin chat wrapper.

It combines multi-provider chat, workspace-aware assistance, scheduled automations, autonomous agents, MCP, browser tooling, markdown-based skills and personas, and a discovery-driven extension system in one desktop product.

## Why Joanium

- Local-first state: chats, projects, skills, personas, memories, usage data, and feature state are stored on the machine instead of being hidden behind a remote app backend.
- Multi-provider by design: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, Mistral, NVIDIA, DeepSeek, MiniMax, Ollama, and LM Studio are already wired into setup and runtime model selection.
- Project-aware chat: the main chat experience can reason over an active workspace, inspect local files, run commands, manage attachments, and keep project-scoped chat history.
- More than chat: Joanium ships pages and engines for automations, agents, skills, personas, marketplace installs, events, and usage analytics.
- Real tool surface: the assistant can use local workspace tools, document extraction, browser preview, MCP servers, connector-backed integrations, and feature-defined chat tools.
- Extensible architecture: features, engines, IPC modules, services, and renderer pages are discovered from npm workspace packages instead of being manually hard-coded into one central file.

- Capability packages for GitHub, GitLab, Google Workspace, and a collection of free connectors.
- Google sub-capabilities for Calendar, Contacts, Docs, Drive, Forms, Gmail, Photos, Sheets, Slides, Tasks, and YouTube.
- MCP support for builtin, stdio, and HTTP servers, including a builtin browser MCP server.
- Channel engine support for Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Slack.
- Document extraction for text/code files, PDF, DOCX, XLSX/XLSM, and PPTX attachments.

```

The key architectural idea is that Joanium is assembled from discovery roots declared in workspace `package.json` files. Feature packages contribute connectors, chat tools, automation data sources, output handlers, prompt context, and even additional pages. Engine packages contribute long-lived runtime behavior. IPC and page registration are also discovered instead of being manually wired one by one.

Important note: in development mode, Joanium stores runtime state inside the repo root. In packaged builds, that state moves to Electron `userData`. That makes local development simple, but it also means contributors should avoid accidentally committing local runtime data.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- A supported AI provider key, or a local model server such as Ollama or LM Studio

### Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

For development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run packages:audit
```

On Windows PowerShell, if `npm` script execution is blocked by policy, run:

```powershell
cmd /c npm run packages:audit
```

## Development Notes

- `App.js` creates required runtime directories, seeds skills/personas and personal memory files, boots the feature system, starts engines, creates the main window, and auto-connects MCP servers.
- `Packages/Main/Boot.js` is the central assembly point for feature discovery, engine discovery, storage creation, lifecycle hooks, and IPC registration.
- `Packages/Renderer/Application/Main.js` is the renderer shell that discovers pages, builds the sidebar, mounts/unmounts pages, and initializes renderer gateways.
- `Packages/Capabilities/Core/FeatureRegistry.js` is the main composition layer for connector definitions, prompt sections, chat tools, automation hooks, and feature pages.

## Extending Joanium

At a high level:

1. Add or update a workspace package.
2. Declare discovery roots through `joanium.discovery` in that package's `package.json`.
3. Export a `Feature.js`, `*Engine.js`, `*IPC.js`, `Page.js`, or `*Service.js` from the matching discovery root.
4. Let boot-time discovery register the new capability automatically.
